# Bus Seat Allocation System – Project & Analysis

## Project Overview
The Bus Seat Allocation System is an online reservation and seat booking
application that enables bus registration, trip scheduling, seat selection,
and booking management. This project is used to demonstrate system
workflow understanding, requirement analysis, and documentation skills.

## Business Objective
- Enable efficient seat allocation and booking management
- Provide visibility into bus schedules and seat availability
- Support operational reporting through downloadable booking details
- Improve customer experience through preference-based seat selection

## Key Functional Features
- Bus registration with structure and stoppage details
- Scheduling of future trips for registered buses
- Customer seat booking based on date, route, and seat preference
- Downloadable booking reports (PDF) for scheduled and completed trips
- Validation checks to ensure smooth and accurate system operation

## System Workflow (High-Level)
1. Bus operators register buses and define routes
2. Trips are scheduled for specific dates and routes
3. Customers search trips using source, destination, and date
4. Available seats are displayed and allocated upon booking
5. Booking data is generated and available for reporting
